Python was created in the late 1980s, and first released in 1991, by Guido van Rossum as a successor to the ABC programming language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced new features, such as list comprehensions, and a garbage collection system with reference counting, and was discontinued with version 2.7 in 2020.[29] Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x[30] and later are supported, with older versions still supporting e.g. Windows 7 (and old installers not restricted to 64-bit Windows).
